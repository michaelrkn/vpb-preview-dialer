When a contact loads, you'll be asked if you want to call them.
The audio will come through your browser.

If you don't make a call at first, you can make it later by pressing "c", or by clicking the phone number.
When you are on the phone, you can press "h" to hang up.

For "Couldn't Reach" statuses, press:
  n: Not Home
  r: Refused
  m: Moved
  b: Busy
  w: Wrong Number
  d: Disconnected
  l: Other Language

You don't need to click "I Couldn't Reach..." - just press the key.
You can also press "s" to open the Scheduler, and "o" to go to Notes (if available).

Then, press Enter for "Save & Next Call".
Or, press "s" for "Skip" (if available).`)
